TODO for Net::DNS
=================

- Fix test coverage, not all are convered or the raw sockets features not existing would have been
  caught much earlier
- Review library, cleanup implementation. There are a couple floating TODOs and general non-idomatic
  code blocks floating around. These should be cleaned up.
- Pull in existing pull requests from upstream.
- Move existing issues from upstream to this fork.
- Fix existing reported issues.
- Move this todo list to issues -.- (realized this while writing)
